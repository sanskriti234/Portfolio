  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>
    I am a Computer Science undergraduate specializing in
    <strong>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</strong>,
    with a strong interest in building
    <strong>AI-powered, cloud-based, and automation-driven systems</strong>
    that solve real-world problems.
  </p>

  <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
    My focus is not limited to model training alone. I work on the
    <strong>engineering side of AI</strong> — designing system architecture,
    integrating pre-trained AI models, building backend APIs, and deploying
    applications on cloud platforms with scalability and efficiency in mind.
  </p>

  <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
    Through my projects, I emphasize clarity, structured problem-solving,
    and practical implementation. I actively use AI as a productivity and
    reasoning tool while ensuring that system design decisions, trade-offs,
    and validations are handled consciously.
  </p>

  <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">Education</h3>

  <p>
    <strong>Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech)</strong><br>
    Computer Science & Engineering (AI & ML)<br>
    Bansal Institute of Engineering and Technology<br>
    <span style="color: var(--muted);">2023 – 2027</span>
  </p>

  <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem;">Career Focus</h3>

  <p>
    I am currently seeking opportunities in
    <strong>internships, research-oriented roles, and entry-level positions</strong>
    where I can contribute to AI-enabled products, cloud services,
    and intelligent automation systems while continuing to learn
    from real-world engineering challenges.
